# Social Care Case Viewer API

The Social Care Service API provides [service API](http://playbook.hackney.gov.uk/API-Playbook/platform_api_vs_service_api#a-service-apis) capabilities for the [Social Care Frontend](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/lbh-social-care) which is part of the Social Care system (see [Social Care System Architecture](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/social-care-architecture/tree/main) for more details).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Dockerised dependencies

- PostgreSQL 12
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone this repository

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:LBHackney-IT/social-care-case-viewer-api.git
```

## Usage

### Running the application

To serve the API locally, use:

```sh
$ cd SocialCareCaseViewerApi && dotnet run
```

The application will be served at http://localhost:5000.

### Running the tests

There are two ways of running the tests: using the terminal and using an IDE.

#### Using the terminal

To run all tests, use:

```sh
$ make test
```

To run some tests i.e. single or a group, run the test databases in the background:

```sh
$ make start-test-dbs
```

And then you can filter through tests, using the `--filter` argument of the
`dotnet test` command:

```sh
# E.g. for a specific test, use the test method name
$ dotnet test --filter GivenHttpClientReturnsValidResponseThenGatewayReturnsListCaseNotesResponse
# E.g. for a file, use the test class name
$ dotnet test --filter SocialCarePlatformAPIGatewayTests
```

If your docker test database is out of sync with the schema on your current banch run

```sh
$ make restart-db
```

See [Microsoft's documentation on running selective unit tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/selective-unit-tests?pivots=mstest) for more information.

#### Using an IDE

Run the test databases in the background, using:

```sh
$ make start-test-dbs
```

This will allow you to run the tests as normal in your IDE.

## Documentation

### Architecture

As this service API is a part of the Social Care System, higher level documentation lives in a separate repository called [Social Care System Architecture](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/social-care-architecture/).

To find out more about the process and tooling for our diagrams, see [Process documentation in Social Care System Architecture](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT/social-care-architecture/blob/main/process.md).

### API design

We use [SwaggerHub](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/) to document the API design, of which we have two versions:

- [Hosted by SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Hackney/social-care-case-viewer-api/1.0.0) - for designing endpoints as a contract before we create a new feature
- [Self-hosted](https://dr03nduqxh.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/staging/swagger/index.html) - for actual endpoint design which is auto-generated using comments

### Databases

The service API has two databases (as seen in the [C4 component diagram](./docs/component-diagram.svg)):

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) (DocumentDB in AWS)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) (RDS PostgreSQL in AWS)

#### Updating the database schema

We currently don't have database migrations set up for the databases which means changes to the schema are documented in the repository and done manually via the AWS console.

If you need to make changes e.g. add a new table to the PostgreSQL database, then see [Updating the database schema](./docs/updating-database-schema.md) for how we manage this and do this via the AWS console.

### Deployment

We have two environments:

- Staging (StagingAPIs AWS account)
- Production (Mosaic-Production AWS account)

and two deployment branches:

- `master` which deploys to Staging and Production
- `development` which deploys to Staging

This means pull request merges into `master` and `development` both trigger a deployment to Staging, but only `master` can trigger a deployment for Production.

To deploy to Production, we first ensure that changes are verified in Staging and then we merge `development` into `master`.

We use CircleCI to handle deployment, see [CircleCI config](./.circleci/config.yml).
