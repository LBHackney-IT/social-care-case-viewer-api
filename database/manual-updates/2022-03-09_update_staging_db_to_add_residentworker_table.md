# Add tables required by the historical data gateway

## The problem we're trying to solve

Adding required table for resident workers, staging needs a manual update to take the changes into account.

## Justification for doing a manual update

We don't have automated migration scripts yet.

## The plan

1. Run the SQL scripts below. Please note this is for staging database on staging account only.

CREATE TABLE if not exists DBO.SCCV_RESIDENTWORKER (
    ID bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY NOT NULL CONSTRAINT XPK_SCCV_RESIDENTWORKER PRIMARY KEY,
    PERSON_ID bigint NOT NULL,
    WORKER_ID bigint NOT NULL,
    TEAM_ID bigint NOT NULL,
    ALLOCATION_DATE timestamp,
